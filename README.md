# ES2015+ features

Just a collection of useful features that I tend to use on a daily basis. Hopefully this is useful
for those who are learning javascript or just exploring some of the many new features of the ES2015+
standard. Keep in mind, that I'm using the AirBnb style guide for my examples and as such, there are
many other ways to go about doing what I'll be showing.

### Variable Declarations
`const` and `let` are used in ES6 and are different from `var` because they are only block scope.
This means that they are only hoisted to the top of the scope block in which they are declared.

### Arrow Functions
This file is to show how simple fat arrow functions are useful to clean up when using callback
functions. They're also useful since they're a couple less keystrokes than using the `function`
keyword.

### Destructuring

### Classes

### Template Strings

### Rest and Spread Operators

### Promises

### React Client
The React folder has a client that an example of a real-world use of object destructuring. Run it
using `npm run server:dev` and type into the fields to see how it works.

### Setup
To get this repo started on your local machine:

- ```npm install``` to get things all dependencies installed
- ```npm run start:dev``` to get Express to serve static content and open up the localhost to
display the sample website.
